See [here](https://www.definder.net/SKRT/) for the definition of skrt.

Always free, never paid.<br />
Your friendly url shortening service.

I've seen a lot of url shortening services, but the majority charge you to view analytics like click rates. Request breakdowns etc. So I made my own, and it's going to be a lot better than those out there.

[Click to go to Skrt](https://skrt.to)

Todo:
- ✅ Add visit counter tech 
- ✅ Ship!
- ✅ Add loading indicator when generating link
- ✅ Add a createdon timestamp in the Link model
- ✅ Add an unlisted boolean to a link
- ✅ Store links with an optional userId
- ✅ View click analytics for the last 7 days, including device breakdown and geographic as well as source of click.
- ✅ Create social share buttons
- ✅ Generate and share qr code for your skrt
- ✅ Search for a skrt
- ✅ View metrics on links via search to analytics
- ✅ Add open source promo and that we will never charge in the footer.

After initial release (I will do these at some point once the motivation for this side project comes back to me):
- ⬜️ Log in with a social provider (nextauth)
- ⬜️ View my skrts dashboard
- ⬜️ Filter the most recent links where they are not unlisted
- ⬜️ Change the homepage to have most recent links displayed and a cta at the top to create a new one.
- ⬜️ Filter the most recent links where they are not unlisted.
